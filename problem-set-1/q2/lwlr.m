function y = lwlr(X_train, y_train, x, tau)
% Fits a logistic regression model to training data, then makes predictions
% on x. Tau is (?)

% These files contain the inputs (x(i) ? R2) and outputs (y(i) ? {?1, 1}),
% respectively for a binary classification problem, with one training 
% example per row. Implement Newton’s method for optimizing J(?),
% and apply it to fit a logistic regression model to the data.
% Initialize Newton’s method with ? = ~0 (the vector of all zeros). 
% What are the coefficients ?
% resulting from your fit? (Remember to include the intercept term.)
